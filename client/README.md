attempted to used render, however my upload failed.
# Unsolved Problems:
I was not able to utilize boostrap the way that I expected and adding the favorites feature was one of my challenges and also I was not able to design and css the way that i invisioned it. my favorite part was creating the search,edit,delete components.
# Future Enhancements:
I would like to add more features and make it more user interactive such as adding more characters details and clicking features. add more bootstrap to make it more clean and user friendly
